Regarding the video December is looking good for crypto,
published on December 06, 2025.
The latest analysis from Coin Bureau trading suggests December
is poised to be a positive month for the crypto market.
This optimism stems from a combination of macro, fiscal,
and crypto-specific catalysts, following a bearish November
that the analyst accurately predicted.
First, on the macro front, attention
is turning to the Federal Reserve.
Fed Governor Williams hinted in November
at the likelihood of the Fed resuming quantitative easing
or bond buying to manage market liquidity.
While the next Fed meeting on December 10th
will be watched for interest rate decisions,
the analyst emphasizes that the Fed's balance sheet changes
and their summary of economic projections,
which forecasts future interest rates
and economic indicators will be far more impactful.
He cautions against short-term volatility around the meeting,
advising a way to see approach for market reactions to settle.
Additionally, fiscal policy looks
set to boost liquidity, the Treasury General Account,
essentially the United States government's bank account,
has begun to drain after the recent government shutdown,
which typically injects liquidity into markets.
Even more significantly, the Supreme Court
is expected to rule on Donald Trump's tariffs
by the end of December.
If these tariffs are struck down,
the United States government would face
refunding hundreds of billions of dollars
to companies that paid them.
This would act as a substantial corporate stimulus,
further draining the Treasury General Account
and greatly increasing market liquidity.
The fact that major corporations like Costco
are already suing for tariff refunds,
suggests this outcome is increasingly anticipated,
turning to crypto-specific catalysts,
two key developments are expected.
One is the Rumored Securities
and Exchange Commission Innovation Exemption,
which could be introduced by the end of December.
This exemption would temporarily legalize
many on-chain crypto activities in the United States,
such as tokenized real world assets
and decentralized finance,
fostering an explosion of experimentation and capital flow,
particularly into all coins.
The second crucial factor is the push
by pro crypto United States politicians
for a vote on the Clarity Act in December.
The analyst draws a parallel to the Genius Act,
which saw Ethereum's price nearly double
over two months in anticipation and after its passing.
Given the Clarity Act addresses broader crypto market structure,
a similar pre-vote rally is anticipated
if it moves to a vote this month.
From a technical perspective,
the analyst highlights the monthly-ballinger band,
moving average as the crucial support level
for the current crypto bull market.
For Bitcoin, this level sits around $88 to $89,000
and for the total crypto market cap,
it is approximately $2.95 to $2.96 trillion.
As long as these levels hold,
the bull market is considered intact,
even in a worst-case scenario.
If this were the end of the bull run,
the analyst expects a sizable bounce,
lasting a couple of months
before any potential further downside.
Overall, combining these macro,
fiscal and crypto-specific factors,
the analysis points to a strong
and potentially very sizable rally,
particularly for all coins,
expected to unfold in the second half of December.
