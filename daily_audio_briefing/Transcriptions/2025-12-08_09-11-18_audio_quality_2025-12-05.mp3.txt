Regarding the video, trend reversal incoming for ETH slash BTC.
Here's what happens next.
Published on December 05, 2025,
building on previous analyzes,
the latest coin bureau trading update
presents a highly bullish outlook specifically
for Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin,
anticipating a significant boost for all coins.
First, the analyst notes that Ethereum
has been underperforming against Bitcoin since August 24th,
dropping approximately 28%.
However, this trend appears to be reversing
with numerous strong bullish signals emerging.
Ethereum has successfully broken
above a crucial short-term resistance level against Bitcoin
and has maintained this position for several days,
indicating a significant shift in trend.
Additionally, Ethereum is now challenging
a major long-term resistance level
that it has struggled to overcome since September 2022.
Having failed in five previous attempts,
proprietary indicators are also flashing rare
and powerful bullish divergence signals,
suggesting Ethereum is primed for a notable bounce.
Furthermore, while Bitcoin is still navigating
a potentially bearish price pattern,
Ethereum's individual price action
shows a healthier structure,
characterized by higher lows
and a break above its own resistance channel.
Another key indicator, the TBO,
has also printed a bullish reversal signal,
reminiscent of a signal scene
before a substantial rally in May.
Crucially, the analyst highlights
that Ethereum traditionally leads altcoin rallies.
Therefore, this anticipated outperformance
of Ethereum against Bitcoin
is expected to drive a broader recovery
across the altcoin market.
Ethereum's dominance in the crypto market
is also showing bullish reversal signs,
indicating that capital is flowing into Ethereum,
which typically benefits lower and mid-cap altcoins.
The primary target for the Ethereum
to Bitcoin trading pair is a historical resistance level
at 0.04163, representing a potential 21% increase.
The analyst suggests that if Ethereum achieves this,
many altcoins could see gains two to three times greater.
The main risk to this bullish scenario
would be a sudden sharp decline in Bitcoin's price.
Overall, the momentum is building for Ethereum
to lead altcoins higher,
with strong bullish reversal signs
manifesting on the charts.
