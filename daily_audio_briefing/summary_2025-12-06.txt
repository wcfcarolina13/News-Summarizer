Regarding the video DECEMBER Is LOOKING GOOD For CRYPTO!! published on December 06, 2025:
This news analysis predicts a substantially positive December for the crypto market, driven by multiple macro and crypto-specific catalysts, though gains are not expected immediately but later in the month.

First, the analyst focuses on macro factors. Key attention should be given to the Federal Reserve’s posture regarding its balance sheet. While most focus on the December tenth Fed meeting interest rate decision, the most important element will be the Summary of Economic Projections, which forecasts future rates and inflation. Additionally, signals regarding Quantitative Easing, or QE, are crucial, as Fed Governor Williams previously indicated the need for the Fed to start buying bonds to manage market liquidity.

Furthermore, fiscal policy is expected to inject liquidity. The Treasury General Account, or TGA, is finally beginning to drain after the recent government shutdown ended, which is typically a bullish sign for overall market liquidity. The most significant potential catalyst, however, relates to the Supreme Court, which is currently deciding on Donald Trump’s tariffs. Many believe the court will strike down these tariffs by the end of December. If this happens, the US government would be forced to refund hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations—a huge drawdown on the TGA and an effective form of corporate stimulus—which would boost liquidity across markets.

Moving to crypto-specific drivers, two major regulatory events are watched closely. The first is the potential introduction of the SEC’s Innovation Exemption by year-end. This exemption would temporarily legalize much of the on-chain crypto activity in the US, allowing increased capital flow into areas like tokenized Real World Assets, Decentralized Finance, and other projects, which would particularly boost altcoins.

The second key factor is the push by pro-crypto politicians for a vote on the Clarity Act in December. The analyst notes that the previous passage of the Genius Act, which focused on stable coins, caused Ethereum’s price to nearly double over two months, with the rally beginning *before* the act was formally passed. Since the Clarity Act addresses the broader crypto market structure, a similar price effect is expected as the market begins to price in its potential passage.

Finally, regarding technical analysis, the analyst maintains that the bull market is intact as long as Bitcoin holds the Bollinger Band Moving Average on the monthly chart, currently around eighty-eight thousand to eighty-nine thousand dollars. This level is also reflected in the Total Crypto Market Cap, currently sitting near two point nine five to two point nine six trillion dollars. Given the concentration of upcoming bullish factors, the analyst expects a strong bounce, with most of the substantial gains arriving in the second half of December.
