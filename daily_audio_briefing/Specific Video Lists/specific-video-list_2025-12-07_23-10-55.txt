An expert news analyst predicts a major "End Update" for Minecraft is likely coming in summer twenty-twenty-seven, coinciding with the release of the next Minecraft movie.

First, this prediction stems from several key observations. A Mojang game designer, URF, reportedly stated in an August twenty-twenty-five interview that an End update is "inevitable" and a "very major update is currently in development." The current period marks the longest gap between major Minecraft updates ever, surpassing the five hundred and forty-five days that preceded the game's last End-focused update, version one point nine, released in two thousand sixteen. Community demand for an End update is also at an all-time high.

Additionally, Mojang's shift to smaller "game drops" (occurring about every ninety days in twenty-twenty-five) still leaves room for major themed updates, as indicated by the absence of a version number one point twenty-two. The upcoming Minecraft movie sequel, scheduled for release on July twenty-third, twenty-twenty-seven, is expected to focus on the End dimension, much like the first movie centered on the Nether. This aligns with Mojang's past strategy of releasing game content tied to movie themes and their stated long-term content plans extending to two thousand twenty-eight.

Second, the current End dimension faces significant player criticisms. Many find it boring, citing a lack of biomes, unique mobs, and structures, which leads to players having little reason to revisit after obtaining an Elytra. Accessibility is another major issue, with polls indicating a substantial portion of players have never even reached the End in survival mode due to the challenging and often undirected process. Players also desire more verticality in islands, caves, and improved multiplayer looting for end ships.

Finally, regarding the potential content of such an update, the successful Nether Update serves as a strong template. An End update would likely introduce new ores with unique anti-void properties, redstone components related to teleportation, and a "respawn anchor" equivalent to allow players to set their spawn point in the End. New biomes are anticipated, possibly drawing inspiration from the "Echoing Void" downloadable content for Minecraft Dungeons, featuring vibrant yet alien flora, toxic pools, and varied structures. Expected mobs include an improved Ender Dragon fight, new mini-bosses, a food source mob like an "Ender Chicken" that lays "void eggs" with teleportation effects, and a friendly "glider" mob to aid in traversing the void before obtaining an Elytra. New structures, similar to the Nether's Bastions and Ruined Portals, are also expected, potentially including a large "Broken Citadel" and smaller abandoned campsites that could offer guaranteed ways to find an Elytra.
